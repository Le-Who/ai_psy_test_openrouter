## 2026-02-01 - [Form Validation & Feedback]
**Learning:** Standard HTML5 `required` attribute allows whitespace, which can lead to empty submissions. Replacing intrusive `alert()` calls with Toasts and focus management creates a much smoother flow.
**Action:** Always combine `required` attributes with explicit JS validation (`.trim()`) for text inputs, and use visual indicators (asterisks) to make expectations clear upfront.

## 2024-05-21 - [Accessible Glassmorphism Menus]
**Learning:** For glassmorphism menus implemented with `div`s, replacing them with semantic `<button`> tags plus a CSS reset (`background: transparent; border: none; text-align: left`) is the most robust way to add accessibility without breaking the visual design.
**Action:** Use the `.theme-opt` CSS reset pattern for any new interactive list items in the design system.

## 2025-05-15 - [Password/Key Visibility Toggle]
**Learning:** Users frequently need to verify pasted API keys to avoid errors. Using a standard `type="password"` input without a toggle is secure but frustrates this verification process.
**Action:** Always provide a "Show/Hide" toggle button for API key or complex password inputs. Ensure the toggle is keyboard accessible and uses ARIA attributes to communicate state changes.
